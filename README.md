The main model is defined in SPAHR_Model.ipynb

This model is based on the paper Agent-based Dynamics of a SPAHR Opioid Model on
Social Network Structures by Quin, Owen Queena, Vincent Jodoina, Leigh B. Pearcya, and W. Christopher
Stricklanda, found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.12261.

The main SPAHR model is contained in the SPAHR_model.ipynb file. 
To be able to run this file you must use python 3.9 as newer versions 
run into isssues with the MESA version based our model off. Our 
package versions were as follows (NOTE NOT ALL PACKAGES LISTED ARE REQUIRED):<br>
